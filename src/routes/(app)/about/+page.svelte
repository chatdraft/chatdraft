	<h1>About Oro Chat Draft</h1>
	<p>
		Oro Chat Draft is an proof of concept for letting Twitch chat draft a Marvel Snap Deck.
		Twitch chat votes on which card to add to the streamer's deck. A browser source
		displays the draft status in real time on stream and a bot in chat announces
		the choices and selections. The streamer doesn't need to interact after
		starting the draft, and can focus on streaming while chat drafts a deck.
		After 12 cards have been selected, the streamer can copy and paste the deck
		code into Marvel Snap.
	</p>
	<p>
		To use the app, you'll need to log in to Twitch and authorize this app 
		to connect to your account and read and manage channel point redemptions.
		Then invite the bot to join your Twitch chat. Then, set up the browser sources
		to display the draft status on stream. The 
		<a class="anchor" href="start">Get Started</a>
		page will walk you through each of these steps.
